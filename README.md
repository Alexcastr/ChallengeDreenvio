# Technical Test Solution

This is a solution for a technical test using Express.js. The application provides two main routes:

## 1. /products

This route returns an array containing only the products that are currently in stock.

## 2. /price/{user_id}/{nombre_producto}

Some clients in this business have special pricing for certain brands. This route returns the special price for the given client and brand, if available. If the client doesn't have a special price for the brand, the route returns the base price.

## Installation

To install and run this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the server with `npm run dev`.

## Usage

To use the application, send a GET request to the `/products` route to get all products in stock. Send a GET request to the `/price/{user_id}/{nombre_producto}` route to get the special price for a given client and brand.

The database name is snekersDB

Throughout the day, I plan to complete the to-do list. Currently, the app is functioning according to the given task.

## Encountered Difficulties

1. The mongoURI was sent separately, and it does not include the name of the database.
2. Planning the connection between the models and collections in order to start developing the app was challenging.
